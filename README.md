# Facial-Expression-Recognition
This repository contains the various files for the Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Graphics Lab project.
The goal of this project is to explore various convolutional neural networks to solve the problem of Facial Expression Recognition by comparing their performance.
To run the various files of the porject you have to add this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WnDjOJArsUH-G_ffOXXO7D7dZCs9lLyH?usp=sharing) to your drive.


# Exploratory Data Analysis
This section performs Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
The analysis is a preliminary tool necessary to understand the structure of the dataset and its particularities (imbalances, NaN values, ...)

# Five-Layers-CNN
The Five-Layers-CNN.ipynb file implements a 5-layer convolutional neural network whose structure is as follows:
After adopting hyperparameter tuning strategies, the following results are obtained:
